### What I learned

Every line of code in this project is something I learned for the first time this week! :)

### Continued development

I am particularly enthusiastic about learning responsive design. I was introduced to this topic via a twitter thread and it is what got me curious enough to build this project to begin with!

This project did not focus on the mobile design challenge, but I am learning about adapting to a mobile format.
